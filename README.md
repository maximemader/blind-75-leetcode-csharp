# Blind 75 LeetCode Problems

Welcome to my repository for implementing the [Blind 75](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions) LeetCode problems! ðŸš€

This repository serves as a structured collection of solutions to the curated list of 75 essential coding problems widely recommended for preparing for technical interviews.

## Contents

The repository is organized into categories based on problem types. Each category contains the corresponding problems and their implementations:

```
/P_Array
    P01_TwoSum.cs
    P02_BestTimeToBuyAndSellStock.cs
    ...
/P_Binary
    P11_SumOfTwoIntegers.cs
    P12_NumberOf1Bits.cs
    ...
...
```

Each file contains the solution to a specific problem, along with comments explaining the approach and logic.

## Categories

The problems are grouped into the following categories:
- [Array](./P_Array)
- [Binary](./P_Binary)
- [Dynamic Programming](./P_DynamicProgramming)
- [Graph](./P_Graph)
- [Heap](./P_Heap)
- [Interval](./P_Interval)
- [Linked List](./P_LinkedList)
- [Matrix](./P_Matrix)
- [String](./P_String)
- [Tree](./P_Tree)

## Languages and Tools

- I have used **C# 13** to implement the solutions and no tools.

## My Experience

Working through the Blind ~~75~~ 69 problems has been a rewarding journey, helping me:
- Develop a deeper understanding of core data structures and algorithms.
- Enhance my problem-solving skills.
- Work on intervals and tries, which I had sporadically encountered before.

I will update this repository when I try LeetCode Premium to solve the remaining 6.

## Acknowledgments

- Thanks to Krishna Dey for curating the Blind 75 list.
- Thanks to LeetCode for providing a platform to practice coding problems.

Happy coding and good luck with your interview prep! ðŸ’»
